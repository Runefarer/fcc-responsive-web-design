            <strong>Accessibility</strong> (often abbreviated to <strong>A11y</strong> — as in "a" then 11 characters
            then "y") in Web development means enabling as many people as possible to use Web sites, even when those
            people's abilities are limited in some way.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many people, technology makes things easier. For people with disabilities, technology makes things
            possible. Accessibility means developing content to be as accessible as possible no matter an individual's
            physical and cognitive abilities and no matter how they access the web.

          <h2>What is Accessibility?</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally
            think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also
            benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accessibility is the right thing to do. Providing accessible sites is part of the law in some countries,
            which can open up some significant markets that otherwise would not be able to use your services or buy your
            products.
          </p>
          <p>Building accessible sites benefit everyone:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as
              mobile phone users or those on low network speed. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such
              improvements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Did we mention it is also the law in some places?

          <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The HTML5 specification introduced several semantic sectioning elements to help organize the structure of
            documents. Semantic sectioning elements are specifically designed to communicate structural meaning to
            browsers and other technologies interpreting the document on behalf of users, such as screen readers and
            voice assistants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from
            the start of your project. Even better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Easier to develop with</strong> — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for free, plus it
              is arguably easier to understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Better on mobile</strong> — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic
              spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Good for SEO</strong> — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links,
              etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, etc., so your documents will be
              more findable by customers.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Some of the semantic HTML elements are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML Navigational Element</strong> (<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>) defines a section that contains
              navigation links that appear often on a site. You can have primary and secondary menus, but you cannot
              nest a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element inside another <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML Article Element</strong> (<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>) defines a piece of self-contained
              content. It does not refer to the main content alone and can be used for comments and widgets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML Section Element</strong> (<code>&lt;section&gt;</code>) defines a section of a document to
              indicate a related grouping of semantic meaning. It makes sense to use the section element to provide
              extra context for the parent element.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML Aside Element</strong> (<code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>) defines a section that, though related to
              the main element, doesn't belong to the main flow, like an explanation box or an advertisement. The aside
              element has its own outline, but doesn't belong to the main one.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML Body Element</strong> (<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>) defines all the content of a document. It
              contains all the content and HTML tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML Header Element</strong> (<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>) defines a page area that typically
              contains a logo, title, and navigation. The header can also be used inside other semantic elements such as
              <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>. A section header might contain the section's
              heading, author name, etc. <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
              <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> can have their own <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>.
              Despite its name, the header is not necessarily positioned at the beginning of a page or section.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML Footer Element</strong> (<code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>) defines a page footer, which typically
              contains copyright or legal notices and sometimes some links. In the context of a section, a footer might
              contain the sectioned content's publication date, license information, etc. <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
              <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> can have their own
              <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. Despite its name, the footer is not necessarily positioned at the end of a
              page or section.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Alternate Text and Figures</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They
            won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the
            <code>alt</code> attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Good <code>alt</code> text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include
            an <code>alt</code> attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an example of an image with the <code>alt</code> attribute set properly:
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            <code>
  &lt;img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo"&gt;
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            HTML5 introduced the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element, along with the related
            <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>. Used together, these items wrap a visual representation (like an image,
            diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically
            grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's an example - note that the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> goes inside the
            <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tags and can be combined with other elements:
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            <code>
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="elephant.jpg" alt="Elephant at sunset"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;An elephant at sunset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
            </code>
          </div>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="proper_labeling" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h2>Proper Labeling</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Form elements need to be labelled properly to be accessible to assisstive technology like screen readers. It
            is not sufficient to just place the label next to the form control, there is additional markup required to
            make forms properly accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or
            label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The <code>for</code>
            attribute on a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag explicitly associates that <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> with the
            form control and is used by screen readers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value of the <code>for</code> attribute must be the same as the value of the <code>id</code> attribute
            of the form control. Here's an example:
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            <code>
  &lt;form&gt;
    &lt;label for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name"&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
            </code>
          </div>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="screen_reader_only_elements" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h2>Screen Reader Only Elements</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Sometimes it is helpful to have an alternative presentations to a visual element to make it more accessible.
            For example, adding a table of data next to a chart visualization. But, you may not want the table of data
            for your visual users since they can already see the chart. In such cases, you can use CSS to hide screen
            reader only content from visual users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's an example of the CSS rules that accomplish this:
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            <code>
  .sr-only {
    position: absolute;
    left: -10000px;
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    top: auto;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            The following CSS approaches will <strong>NOT</strong> do the same thing:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>display: none;</code> or <code>visibility: hidden;</code> hides content for everyone, including
              screen reader users.
            </li>
            <li>
              Zero values for pixel sizes, such as <code>width: 0px; height: 0px;</code> removes that element from the
              flow of your document, meaning screen readers will ignore it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="screen_reader_hidden_elements" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h2>Screen Reader Hidden Elements</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Using CSS, you can style your page however you want. In some CSS approaches, you might want to add certain
            styles that repeat or have visual elements that offer no information other than being there for visual
            flavor. Such elements will confuse screen reader users, and it is helpful to have them hidden from screen
            readers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute with its value set to <code>true</code> will make that
            particular element hidden from the screen reader but still visible visually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's an example of this approach:
          </p>
          <div class="codeblock">
            <code>
  &lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div class="full-content"&gt;
      Hello World
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="half-overlay" aria-hidden="true"&gt;
      Hello World
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
            </code>
          </div>

      <section id="color_contrast" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h2>Color Contrast</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Low contrast between the foreground and background colors can make text difficult to read. Sufficient
            contrast improves the readability of your content, but what exactly does "sufficient" mean?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal
            text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1
            for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the strongest contrast. There are many
            contrast checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's an example of bad color contrast with a ratio of <strong>2.18</strong>:
          </p>
          <p class="color-contrast bad-color-contrast">
            This block has bad color contrast!
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's an example of good color contrast with a ratio of <strong>9.18</strong>:
          </p>
          <p class="color-contrast good-color-contrast">
            This block has good color contrast!
          </p>
          <p>
            When choosing a color scheme for your website, choose foreground and background colors that have good
            contrast.
          </p>
          <p>
            The color contrast between background and foreground content should be at a minimum level to ensure
            legibility:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Text and its background should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heading (or just larger) text should have a ratio of at least 3:1. Larger text is defined as at least
              18pt, or 14pt bold.
